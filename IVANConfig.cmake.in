# IVANConfig.cmake - IVAN CMake configuration file for external projects.
#
# This file is configured by IVAN and used to load IVAN's settings for an 
# external project that uses IVAN. This is done in the following steps:
# 1) Add the line FIND_PACKAGE(IVAN) to the project that uses IVAN.
# 2) Check the cmake variable IVAN_FOUND and include IVAN_USE_FILE if true:
#    IF(IVAN_FOUND)
#	   INCLUDE(${IVAN_USE_FILE})
#    ELSE(IVAN_FOUND)
#      MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "IVAN library not found. Please set IVAN_DIR." )
#    ENDIF(IVAN_FOUND)
# 3) Set the path of the IVAN_DIR cache entry to the directory containing 
#    IVANConfig.cmake. This is the binaries directory for the IVAN project. 
#
# The variables that are imported from the internal IVAN configuration
# are listed below

# The IVAN source tree.
